STAMFORD, CONN. AND DUBLIN, IRELAND – The Stellwagen Group (the “Group”), the global aviation industry’s leading provider of fully-integrated asset management, technical management and fleet and capital financing solutions, today announced the appointment of Scott Corman to the role of Chief Executive Officer of Stellwagen Capital Limited (“StellCap”) effectively immediately, and David Butler to the role of Chief Operating Officer of the Group, effective October 1, 2017.

“We are extremely excited to assign Scott new leadership responsibilities and add David to the team at a time when the aviation sector’s demand for innovative financing solutions continues to increase alongside institutional investors’ appetite for alternative investments that offer stable yield and low correlation to traditional asset classes,” said the Group’s Founder and Chief Executive Officer, Douglas Brennan.  “Scott’s structured finance expertise and David’s innovative management practices position us to seize these sizable opportunities and solidify our strong position in the marketplace. They will also play key roles in accelerating our integration of the aviation advisory and asset management business we acquired from ECN Capital.”

Prior to joining the Group as part of the ECN Capital transaction, Mr. Corman served as an Executive Managing Director leading the firm’s expansion into structured finance services in both the rail and aircraft markets. He previously spent 13 years as Head of the Transportation Asset Finance team at Credit Suisse AG in New York. His track record of architecting numerous award-winning transactions and experience launching the largest ABS transaction in aviation marketplace history align extremely well with the Group’s goals for StellCap.

Mr. Brennan added the following regarding Mr. Corman’s appointment: “In addition to applying his expertise to managing StellCap’s senior loan fund and structured products, Scott brings vast experience and relationships that powerfully highlight our commitment to the leasing community. His leadership will also allow us to enhance and expand our capital raising initiatives.”

A native of Ireland, Mr. Butler previously spent more than a decade at Digicel Group, a leading provider of affordable and innovative mobile services, enterprise solutions and cloud computing. He most recently served as Chief Executive Officer of the firm’s Jamaica, Panama and Fiji businesses and was responsible for exponential growth in several regions. His transformational leadership techniques will now support the Group’s efforts to drive new operational efficiencies, disciplined performance management and sustainable growth.

Mr. Brennan concluded with the following regarding Mr. Butler’s appointment: “David has an impressive track record of growing businesses. By positioning David to drive operations and focus on strategic opportunities, we will bring tremendous enhancements and efficiencies to the Group’s structure. From helping to streamline reporting lines to freeing up other team members for business development and client management, we view the addition of David as an invaluable growth catalyst.”

In conjunction with these appointments, Howard Millar has indicated his intention to leave the organization shortly.
