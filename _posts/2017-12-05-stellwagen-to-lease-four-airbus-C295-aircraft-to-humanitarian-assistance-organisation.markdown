DUBLIN – Stellwagen has signed an agreement to lease four Airbus C295 aircraft to DAC Aviation International, a premier humanitarian operator. DAC will commence humanitarian operations with two aircraft in Q1 2018 operating in Africa. This partnership allows the humanitarian missions to safely operate the new, multiple-use aircraft in austere African environments and immediately provide a new standard of relief services to people in peril.

Seraph Aviation Management, the aviation asset management company of Stellwagen Group, headquartered in Dublin, Ireland will manage the aircraft.  In June 2017, Stellwagen Group signed a firm order for twelve Airbus C295 specialised cargo aircraft with an option to purchase additional aircraft. This was the first sale to a leasing company by Airbus Defence and Space. The Airbus/Stellwagen partnership was formed to commercialise the Airbus C295 aircraft across civil markets including humanitarian agencies, search and rescue operations, and cargo businesses working in some of the most challenging operational theatres around the globe.

The Airbus C295 is the aircraft of choice for the humanitarian assistance organisations due to its superior performance and capabilities, especially its ability to take off and land over short distances and from unimproved surfaces. The Airbus C295 is a twin turboprop multi-role transport aircraft manufactured in Spain.

Douglas Brennan, CEO, Stellwagen Group, said: “This is a tremendous opportunity for our company to make a difference. I am delighted to work with DAC Aviation to provide critical support and assistance to the less fortunate. The Airbus C295 is an ideal aircraft for this mission. It operates a multitude of missions in difficult environments”.

Emmanuel Anassis, Chairman of DAC Aviation stated “We greatly appreciate this opportunity and partnership with our friends from Stellwagen Group. Introducing the Airbus C295 and its tremendous capabilities into our operations will significantly enhance our mission allowing us to take our 25 years of Humanitarian Assistance to the next level as we continue to deliver hope to those less fortunate.”

ABOUT DAC AVIATION INTERNATIONAL

DAC Aviation was founded on an unwavering determination to make a difference. In the early 1990’s Emmanuel Anassis, DAC Aviation’s chairman and founder, identified an opportunity in the African humanitarian air transportation market. Working as a humanitarian pilot in east Africa he noticed that international humanitarian aid organisations were lacking access to a stable, reliable and safe air service provider. In response to this market need, DAC began operations in 1993 with a single DHC-5 Buffalo aircraft, a contract with UNICEF and a handful of dedicated engineers and pilots with a passion and desire to make a difference.
