DAC will commence humanitarian operations with two aircraft in Q1 2018 operating in Africa. This partnership allows the humanitarian missions to safely operate the new, multiple-use aircraft in austere African environments and immediately provide a new standard of relief services to people in peril.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seraph Aviation Management, the aviation asset management company of Stellwagen Group, headquartered in Dublin, Ireland will manage the aircraft.  In June 2017, Stellwagen Group signed a firm order for twelve Airbus C295 specialised cargo aircraft with an option to purchase additional aircraft. This was the first sale to a leasing company by Airbus Defence and Space. The Airbus/Stellwagen partnership was formed to commercialise the Airbus C295 aircraft across civil markets including humanitarian agencies, search and rescue operations, and cargo businesses working in some of the most challenging operational theatres around the globe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Airbus C295 is the aircraft of choice for the humanitarian assistance organisations due to its superior performance and capabilities, especially its ability to take off and land over short distances and from unimproved surfaces. The Airbus C295 is a twin turboprop multi-role transport aircraft manufactured in Spain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Douglas Brennan, CEO, Stellwagen Group, said: “This is a tremendous opportunity for our company to make a difference. I am delighted to work with DAC Aviation to provide critical support and assistance to the less fortunate. The Airbus C295 is an ideal aircraft for this mission. It operates a multitude of missions in difficult environments”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emmanuel Anassis, Chairman of DAC Aviation stated “We greatly appreciate this opportunity and partnership with our friends from Stellwagen Group. Introducing the Airbus C295 and its tremendous capabilities into our operations will significantly enhance our mission allowing us to take our 25 years of Humanitarian Assistance to the next level as we continue to deliver hope to those less fortunate.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ABOUT DAC AVIATION INTERNATIONAL&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DAC Aviation was founded on an unwavering determination to make a difference. In the early 1990’s Emmanuel Anassis, DAC Aviation’s chairman and founder, identified an opportunity in the African humanitarian air transportation market. Working as a humanitarian pilot in east Africa he noticed that international humanitarian aid organisations were lacking access to a stable, reliable and safe air service provider. In response to this market need, DAC began operations in 1993 with a single DHC-5 Buffalo aircraft, a contract with UNICEF and a handful of dedicated engineers and pilots with a passion and desire to make a difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We are extremely excited to assign Scott new leadership responsibilities and add David to the team at a time when the aviation sector’s demand for innovative financing solutions continues to increase alongside institutional investors’ appetite for alternative investments that offer stable yield and low correlation to traditional asset classes,” said the Group’s Founder and Chief Executive Officer, Douglas Brennan.  “Scott’s structured finance expertise and David’s innovative management practices position us to seize these sizable opportunities and solidify our strong position in the marketplace. They will also play key roles in accelerating our integration of the aviation advisory and asset management business we acquired from ECN Capital.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prior to joining the Group as part of the ECN Capital transaction, Mr. Corman served as an Executive Managing Director leading the firm’s expansion into structured finance services in both the rail and aircraft markets. He previously spent 13 years as Head of the Transportation Asset Finance team at Credit Suisse AG in New York. His track record of architecting numerous award-winning transactions and experience launching the largest ABS transaction in aviation marketplace history align extremely well with the Group’s goals for StellCap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. Brennan added the following regarding Mr. Corman’s appointment: “In addition to applying his expertise to managing StellCap’s senior loan fund and structured products, Scott brings vast experience and relationships that powerfully highlight our commitment to the leasing community. His leadership will also allow us to enhance and expand our capital raising initiatives.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A native of Ireland, Mr. Butler previously spent more than a decade at Digicel Group, a leading provider of affordable and innovative mobile services, enterprise solutions and cloud computing. He most recently served as Chief Executive Officer of the firm’s Jamaica, Panama and Fiji businesses and was responsible for exponential growth in several regions. His transformational leadership techniques will now support the Group’s efforts to drive new operational efficiencies, disciplined performance management and sustainable growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. Brennan concluded with the following regarding Mr. Butler’s appointment: “David has an impressive track record of growing businesses. By positioning David to drive operations and focus on strategic opportunities, we will bring tremendous enhancements and efficiencies to the Group’s structure. From helping to streamline reporting lines to freeing up other team members for business development and client management, we view the addition of David as an invaluable growth catalyst.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conjunction with these appointments, Howard Millar has indicated his intention to leave the organization shortly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stellwagen Capital’s Asset Under Management reaches almost €1.6 billion Stellwagen Capital, part of the Stellwagen Group, a leading commercial aviation advisory and asset management business, announced today (Tuesday, 18 July 2017), that it has given its first loan from its recently launched Senior Loan investment vehicle (Stelloan Investment Company I DAC). The 10-year loan to CALC is secured against a new Airbus A321 valued at $116 million, at current list prices. The loan has a balloon structure, which makes it a very attractive financing option for leasing companies and airlines as it minimises cash outflows during the tenor of the loan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commenting on the significance of this key transaction, Douglas Brennan, CEO of Stellwagen Group said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This is a game changer for the Group as we have now successfully expanded our operation and issued our first loan to CALC. We see substantial opportunities to further develop this business as the total aircraft financing market expands to in excess of $200 billion in 2017. The effective closure of the European and U.S. Export Credits Agencies, along with the retrenchment of the commercial aviation banks post Lehman Brothers, has created a real opportunity to grow our business by delivering new innovative financing structures to both airlines and leasing companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Howard Millar CEO of Stellwagen Capital and COO of Stellwagen Group said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We have received great interest from around the world for our new innovative loan solutions and we are delighted to conclude this important first loan transaction with CALC, an internationally recognised lessor. A second Airbus A321, with a similar list price will be financed by us for CALC in late September. This new senior loan product delivers innovative and bespoke financing to airlines and lessors, secured against high quality and liquid aircraft collateral, like the Airbus A321. We have a pipeline of similar opportunities, which we will execute over the coming months. This loan, in addition to the recent acquisition of ECN Capital’s commercial and aviation advisory and asset management business (“ECN”), based in Stamford Connecticut, will bring Stellwagen Capital’s total assets under management (“AUM”) to almost $1.6 billion. By the end of 2017, we expect to have in excess of $3 billion of AUM”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Christian McCormick, Managing Director, Finance of CALC said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We are very proud to establish the partnership with Stellwagen Capital, a world-class and new financier offering innovative solutions, and being part of the initial investment of its senior secured aircraft financing company. The transaction again highlights that CALC’s fundamental business strength is recognised among international investors and financiers. Looking forward, CALC will continue to explore a variety of financing channels in the global capital markets to ensure flexibility for its sustainable development and business expansion plans globally.”&lt;/p&gt;
