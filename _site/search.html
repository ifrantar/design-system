        "content": "DUBLIN – Stellwagen has signed an agreement to lease four Airbus C295 aircraft to DAC Aviation International, a premier humanitarian operator. DAC will commence humanitarian operations with two aircraft in Q1 2018 operating in Africa. This partnership allows the humanitarian missions to safely operate the new, multiple-use aircraft in austere African environments and immediately provide a new standard of relief services to people in peril.Seraph Aviation Management, the aviation asset management company of Stellwagen Group, headquartered in Dublin, Ireland will manage the aircraft.  In June 2017, Stellwagen Group signed a firm order for twelve Airbus C295 specialised cargo aircraft with an option to purchase additional aircraft. This was the first sale to a leasing company by Airbus Defence and Space. The Airbus/Stellwagen partnership was formed to commercialise the Airbus C295 aircraft across civil markets including humanitarian agencies, search and rescue operations, and cargo businesses working in some of the most challenging operational theatres around the globe.The Airbus C295 is the aircraft of choice for the humanitarian assistance organisations due to its superior performance and capabilities, especially its ability to take off and land over short distances and from unimproved surfaces. The Airbus C295 is a twin turboprop multi-role transport aircraft manufactured in Spain.Douglas Brennan, CEO, Stellwagen Group, said: “This is a tremendous opportunity for our company to make a difference. I am delighted to work with DAC Aviation to provide critical support and assistance to the less fortunate. The Airbus C295 is an ideal aircraft for this mission. It operates a multitude of missions in difficult environments”.Emmanuel Anassis, Chairman of DAC Aviation stated “We greatly appreciate this opportunity and partnership with our friends from Stellwagen Group. Introducing the Airbus C295 and its tremendous capabilities into our operations will significantly enhance our mission allowing us to take our 25 years of Humanitarian Assistance to the next level as we continue to deliver hope to those less fortunate.”ABOUT THE STELLWAGEN GROUPThe Stellwagen Group provides capital to industries in which it has a deep operating and financial capability and understanding. Working in the aviation and critical infrastructure space the Group combines innovative financial, operating and technology solutions to maximise returns and minimise risks for its own capital and for capital under its management.ABOUT SERAPH AVIATION MANAGEMENTBased in Dublin, Seraph Aviation Management is a leading provider of aircraft management services. It offers a broad range of aircraft and lease management services to customers in the airline, manufacturing, and finance sectors. It manages investment strategies for its investors and is not an asset owner. Seraph Aviation Management was acquired in 2015 by Stellwagen and re-branded. Previously, Seraph Aviation Management was operating as Volito Aviation Services Ireland.ABOUT DAC AVIATION INTERNATIONALDAC Aviation was founded on an unwavering determination to make a difference. In the early 1990’s Emmanuel Anassis, DAC Aviation’s chairman and founder, identified an opportunity in the African humanitarian air transportation market. Working as a humanitarian pilot in east Africa he noticed that international humanitarian aid organisations were lacking access to a stable, reliable and safe air service provider. In response to this market need, DAC began operations in 1993 with a single DHC-5 Buffalo aircraft, a contract with UNICEF and a handful of dedicated engineers and pilots with a passion and desire to make a difference.CONTACTFor further information email C295@stellwagengroup.com",

        "content": "STELLWAGEN CAPITAL’S ASSET UNDER MANAGEMENT REACHES ALMOST €1.6 BILLIONStellwagen Capital’s Asset Under Management reaches almost €1.6 billion Stellwagen Capital, part of the Stellwagen Group, a leading commercial aviation advisory and asset management business, announced today (Tuesday, 18 July 2017), that it has given its first loan from its recently launched Senior Loan investment vehicle (Stelloan Investment Company I DAC). The 10-year loan to CALC is secured against a new Airbus A321 valued at $116 million, at current list prices. The loan has a balloon structure, which makes it a very attractive financing option for leasing companies and airlines as it minimises cash outflows during the tenor of the loan.Commenting on the significance of this key transaction, Douglas Brennan, CEO of Stellwagen Group said:“This is a game changer for the Group as we have now successfully expanded our operation and issued our first loan to CALC. We see substantial opportunities to further develop this business as the total aircraft financing market expands to in excess of $200 billion in 2017. The effective closure of the European and U.S. Export Credits Agencies, along with the retrenchment of the commercial aviation banks post Lehman Brothers, has created a real opportunity to grow our business by delivering new innovative financing structures to both airlines and leasing companies.Howard Millar CEO of Stellwagen Capital and COO of Stellwagen Group said:“We have received great interest from around the world for our new innovative loan solutions and we are delighted to conclude this important first loan transaction with CALC, an internationally recognised lessor. A second Airbus A321, with a similar list price will be financed by us for CALC in late September. This new senior loan product delivers innovative and bespoke financing to airlines and lessors, secured against high quality and liquid aircraft collateral, like the Airbus A321. We have a pipeline of similar opportunities, which we will execute over the coming months. This loan, in addition to the recent acquisition of ECN Capital’s commercial and aviation advisory and asset management business (“ECN”), based in Stamford Connecticut, will bring Stellwagen Capital’s total assets under management (“AUM”) to almost $1.6 billion. By the end of 2017, we expect to have in excess of $3 billion of AUM”.Christian McCormick, Managing Director, Finance of CALC said:“We are very proud to establish the partnership with Stellwagen Capital, a world-class and new financier offering innovative solutions, and being part of the initial investment of its senior secured aircraft financing company. The transaction again highlights that CALC’s fundamental business strength is recognised among international investors and financiers. Looking forward, CALC will continue to explore a variety of financing channels in the global capital markets to ensure flexibility for its sustainable development and business expansion plans globally.”ABOUT STELLWAGEN GROUPThe Group has a number of companies headquartered in Dublin, Ireland, Stellwagen Capital, Stellwagen Finance Company, Seraph Aviation Management and Stellwagen Technology.ABOUT STELLWAGEN CAPITAL LIMITEDStellwagen Capital Limited (“StellCap”) is the exclusive credit investing arm of the Stellwagen Group, focused on credit-oriented investment strategies in industries in which the Group has exceptional operating and financial competence.
